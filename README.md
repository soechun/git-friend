## Deployment Setup
- Deployment is done through nginx server and pm2.  Nginx server is used as a reverse proxy to localhost:port. pm2 is used to run, monitor and later add as system startup for the vue application.
- Here is more on [nginx reverse proxy](https://www.nginx.com/resources/admin-guide/reverse-proxy/)
- Here is more on [pm2](http://pm2.keymetrics.io/)
